# Predicting camera quality using reviews with Neural Networks
This project is about the creation of a Neural Network using Keras to predict the camera quality of a smartphone with based on user reviews. The objective is that with only one review from a retailer like Amazon, we can estimate the quality of a phone's camera. 

You will need the following libraries:

- keras 
- nltk
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
